# fremtind-case

## task 1
I chose to do the frontend-task, where I was supposed to recreate the picture in the task description. I used react to create a mobile web-app with the dimensions of iPhone 11. I also added some fictitious functionality, where *Avtaledokument (PDF)* downloads a PDF and *Fakturaoversikt* takes you to a new side.

### Quick start
1. Clone this repo
2. Navigate to the fremtind-case folder
3. Run the ```yarn start``` command from the terminal

The application is also available at  https://fremtind-app.herokuapp.com/

## Task 2
Measures that the developers have done to maintain security and privacy in this solution could be:
- Have a login page with i.e. BankID or an username and password with a two factor authentication.
- The right use of encryption and firewall.

## Task 3
How the developers and designers have maintained an universal design:
- An user interface that can be used with a keyboard: use tab to navigate through clickable objects.
- Clear marking of the clickable objects in the user interface.
- The possibility to enlarge the page.
- Understandable link text.
- short and concise page with a lot of information with little text.
