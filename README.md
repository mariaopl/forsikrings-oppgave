# fremtind-case

## task 1
I chose to do the frontend-task, where I was supposed to recreate the picture in the task description. I used react to create a mobile web-app with the dimensions of iPhone 11. I also added some fictitious functionality, where Avtaledokument (PDF) downloads a PDF and Fakturaoversikt takes you to a new side.

### Quick start
1. Clone this repo
2. Navigate to the fremtind-case folder
3. Run the ```yarn start``` command from the terminal

The application is also available at  https://fremtind-app.herokuapp.com/
